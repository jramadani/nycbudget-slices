# Slices of the New York City Budget

This project is a work in progress as of 11/22/2021.

## Abstract

This capstone project is intended to function as a single, centralized explanatory narrative that seeks to: 1) facilitate a holistic understanding of the New York City government budget; and 2) conduct a 5-year analysis of the budget breakdown by NYC Community Boards. The project has three main intended audiencesâ€”activists who need a way to reference and advocate for changes in the budget spending that is comprehensible and easily accessible, NYC residents who need more transparent information about how their tax dollars are spent, and city officials who want to learn about alternative methods of visualizing budgets. These needs will be addressed through clear and accessible explanations of common terms used in budgeting as well as concisely communicated and annotated data visualizations that will illustrate these explanations and other written points made throughout the project.
