<h2 class="section-title">Part One: Cutting to the Core</h2>
<section id="scrolly">

<article id="part-one">
  <div class="step sequence" data-step="1">
<p>When we hear about the NYC budget, it tends to be presented as a monolith, one object that controls the funding that keeps New York City running. Contrary to that narrative, what we think of as the city budget is not so much one cohesive unit, but many components coming together under the same name—like an apple is made up of a peel, stem, core, seeds, and the fruit inside.</p>
<p>According to the Independent Budget Office, the <span class="highlighted">expense budget </span>  is what people tend to think of when they contemplate the budget. The expense budget funds:</p>
<ul class="budget-overview">
<li>City employee salaries</li>
<li>Pensions</li>
<li>Debt service</li>
<li>Supplies to run the city</li>
</ul>

<p>So it’s <em>some</em> of what people think of, but not everything. These funds are set aside for items that remain fairly consistent.
</p>

<p>But what about money set aside for things like improving your local library or fixing potholes? Those allocations tend to be made in the <span class="highlighted">capital budget</span>, which covers one fiscal year (we’ll cover fiscal years in the next section), and funds <span class="highlighted">physical infrastructure</span> used in support of:</p>
<ul class="budget-overview">
  <li>Government operations (funding government offices, schools, fire stations, etc)</li>
  <li>General public use (roads, bridges, libraries, parks)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="highlighted">Office of Management and Budgets (OMB)</span> is in charge of approving projects submitted under the capital budget, and in order to meet approval requirements, projects have to have:</p>
<ul class="budget-overview">
  <li>a value of at least $35,000</li>
  <li>Probable usefulness for at least 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>When considering projects, the OMB will consult technical experts to assess the validity and use of the project, making sure that they actually contribute to the city.</p>

<p>In addition to funding people and projects, the budget also contains a <span class="highlighted">contract budget</span>, which is considered a subset of the expense budget and covers allocations for city entities that hire contractors and other contractual services.</p>

<p>There’s also the <span class="highlighted">financial plan</span>, which is presented alongside the budget and is released on a quarterly basis. This tracks city spending and revenues over a number of years, and each release has its own name depending on when it is released.</p>

<p>The <span class="highlighted">capital program</span> (adjacent to the capital budget) is a plan that manages allocations for capital projects for the current fiscal year as well as the next three. It manages not only new projects from the capital budget, but also projects that have already been started.</p>

<div><h2>Part Two: Chewing on the Slices</h2></div>
<div><p>Now that you've gotten to know the budget a little better, let's dig in and figure out what it looks like close up.<br><br>Over the past five years, the budget has steadily increased&mdash;that is, until the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>Because the budget for 2020 was created in 2019, we hit peak allocation for this five-year period in 2020. This is why you see a reduction in total allocation for FY 2021.</p></div>

<div><p>These are the top 10 agencies and departments by modified budget. Our first instinct might be to inspect these, but when we focus on the biggest department spenders, we tend to miss smaller stories that impact our communities and the way we live our daily lives. So let's try looking at something a little closer to the ground!</p></div>
<div id="heatmap" class="viz"></div>
<div><p>In  New York City, we have several levels of government ranging from federal to state to city to community. At the closest level, our community government is comprised of our community boards.<br><br>Community boards are a group of elected members from your local community who decide what projects should be worked on to improve the community. They're responsible for some public works projects as well as initiatives and hearing concerns from people within their field of influence.</p>

<div id="ch-details" class="viz"></div>
<div id="ch-area" class="viz"></div>
<div><p>Why do community boards in Manhattan receive more funds than community boards in other boroughs? Is it systemic inequality or is it that the cost of living impacts even our own governments?</p></div>
<div id="summs"></div>
<div id="top-CB-treemap" class="viz"></div>
<div><p>The answer is: both. Use the dropdowns to select a community board and compare two of them against one another.</p></div>
