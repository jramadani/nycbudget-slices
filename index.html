<h2 class="section-title">Part One: Cutting to the Core</h2>
<section id="scrolly">
<article id="part-one">
  <div>
<p>When we hear about the NYC budget, it tends to be presented as a monolith, one object that controls the funding that keeps New York City running. Contrary to that narrative, what we think of as the city budget is not so much one cohesive unit, but many components coming together under the same name—like an apple is made up of a peel, stem, core, seeds, and the fruit inside.</p>
<p class="step sequence" data-step="1">According to the Independent Budget Office, the <span class="highlighted">expense budget </span>  is what people tend to think of when they contemplate the budget. The expense budget funds:</p>
<ul class="budget-overview">
<li>City employee salaries</li>
<li>Pensions</li>
<li>Debt service</li>
<li>Supplies to run the city</li>
</ul>

<p>So it’s <em>some</em> of what people think of, but not everything. These funds are set aside for items that remain fairly consistent.
</p>

<p class="step sequence" data-step="2">But what about money set aside for things like improving your local library or fixing potholes? Those allocations tend to be made in the <span class="highlighted">capital budget</span>, which covers one fiscal year (we’ll go over fiscal years in the next section), and funds <span class="highlighted">physical infrastructure</span> used in support of:</p>
<ul class="budget-overview">
  <li>Government operations (funding government offices, schools, fire stations, etc)</li>
  <li>General public use (roads, bridges, libraries, parks)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="highlighted">Office of Management and Budgets (OMB)</span> is in charge of approving projects submitted under the capital budget, and in order to meet approval requirements, projects have to have:</p>
<ul class="budget-overview">
  <li>a value of at least $35,000</li>
  <li>Probable usefulness for at least 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>When considering projects, the OMB will consult technical experts to assess the validity and use of the project, making sure that they actually contribute to the city.</p>

<p class="step sequence" data-step="3">In addition to funding people and projects, the budget also contains a <span class="highlighted">contract budget</span>, which is considered a subset of the expense budget and covers allocations for city entities that hire contractors and other contractual services.</p>

<p class="step sequence" data-step="4">There’s also the <span class="highlighted">financial plan</span>, which is presented alongside the budget and is released on a quarterly basis. This tracks city spending and revenues over a number of years, and each release has its own name depending on when it is released.</p>

<p class="step sequence" data-step="5">The <span class="highlighted">capital program</span> (adjacent to the capital budget) is a plan that manages allocations for capital projects for the current fiscal year as well as the next three. It manages not only new projects from the capital budget, but also projects that have already been started.</p>


<p class="step sequence" data-step="6">Don’t be fooled by its name—the <span class="highlighted">10 Year Capital Strategy</span> isn’t actually related to the capital program or the capital budget. Instead, it exists to talk about developing facilities for the next ten years, and is issued by the Mayor by April 26th of each odd-numbered fiscal year.</p>

<p class="step sequence" data-step="7">Finally, the <span class="highlighted">revenue budget</span> exists to estimate how much money the NYC government will take in to fund all of these various components—despite not being an allocation budget, it’s an essential piece of the puzzle, which we’ll get more into when we talk about balancing the budget. The revenue budget includes:</p>
<ul class="budget-overview">
  <li>Collections of taxes (e.g. property taxes, personal income taxes, sales tax)</li>
  <li>City income from license fees, permits, rent, etc</li>
  <li>Federal and state funding in the form of categorical grants for programs/services</li>
</ul>
<p>Though most of these components operate independently of each other, they serve the same function of keeping the city running. Crafting all of these separate sections takes a lot of work, and a lot of time. </p>

<div id="fisc-explanation">
  <p class="step sequence" data-step="8">When we talk about years in budgeting, you might picture a standard Gregorian calendar like the one on the left. This isn’t usually the case, though.</p>

  <p class="step sequence" data-step="9">Rather than beginning at the start of the calendar year, NYC’s budget process begins in the middle and spans across two calendar years, operating on a cycle like most other budgets also do.</p>
  <p class="step sequence" data-step="10">Per the City Charter, our budget cycle begins on July 1st and goes through the calendar year all the way until June, where the Executive Budget is adopted by the City Council and becomes what’s known as the Adopted Budget.</p>
  <p class="step sequence" data-step="11">By September 3rd, the Mayor is supposed to release the Capital Commitment Plan, which is a plan detailing funds that are legally obligated to be spent on capital projects. If you want to dig into the data on this, it's available on NYC Open Data <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Capital-Commitment-Plan/2cmn-uidm">here.</a></p>
    <p class="step sequence" data-step="12">October has two deadlines, both involving community boards, which we'll be looking into later. According to the Office of Management and Budget, <span class="highlighted">before</span> October 31st, community boards are supposed to <span class="highlighted">complete their capital and expense budget consultations with city agencies</span>. This means that they set up plans to talk about specific projects that will be done in the community as well as their viability. By October 31st, those community boards are also supposed to submit their capital and expense budget priorities to the OMB.</p>
      <p class="step sequence" data-step="13">By December 31st, the Mayor is slated to release a Financial Plan, which updates the Adopted Budget. This was part of our portions of the budget explanation, and provides updated numbers of income and expenses for the city. </p>
      <p class="step sequence" data-step="14">January is a very busy month for the Mayor's office in regard to the budget: by January 16th, the Mayor releases the preliminary budget for the upcoming fiscal year (in this case, that would be July 2022 - June 2023). If it's an odd-numbered <span class="highlighted">calendar year</span>, they also release the preliminary ten-year capital strategy. On the community board side of things, boards should hear back about their budget priorities&mdash;this means it takes approximately two and a half months for them to hear back about their budgets.</p>
      <p class="step sequence" data-step="15">Community boards then have approximately one month (from January 16 to February 16) to review the preliminary budget and submit a written response to the Mayor. <a href="https://www.cb5.org/cb5m/resolutions/2018-march/community-board-five-response-to/">Here's an example of a written response to the Mayor's preliminary budget from Manhattan Community Board #5!</a> </p>
      <p class="step sequence" data-step="16">By February 25th, borough boards submit their budget priorities to the Mayor and City Council. Borough boards are comprised of the following people:</p>
<ul class="budget-overview">
  <li>The borough president</li>
  <li>Council members representing the borough</li>
  <li>The chairpersons of all the community boards in the borough</li>
</ul>

      <p class="step sequence" data-step="17">On March 10th, two things happen: 1) the City Council submits its operating budget; and 2) the Borough Presidents issue recommendations for the Preliminary Budget.</p>
      <p class="step sequence" data-step="18">By March 25th, the city council should start holding hearings, proposing recommendations for the preliminary budget.</p>
      <p class="step sequence" data-step="19">On April 26th, things really start moving: 1) the Mayor submits the Executive Budget and the Message of the Mayor; 2) if it's an odd-numbered calendar year, the Mayor releases the 10-year Capital Strategy; and 3) the Community Boards receive responses from the Mayor to their budget priorities.</p>
      <p class="step sequence" data-step="20">The City Council holds hearings on the Executive Budget over three weeks (May 6 - 25). During the pandemic, these have been conducted over Zoom and citizens can watch virtually&mdash;generally, council members will come to these meetings having heard from their constituents about various topics they care about, and will represent those concerns accordingly at these meetings.</p>
      <p class="step sequence" data-step="21">The Executive Budget is adopted by the City Council, becoming the Adopted Budget.</p>
      <p class="step sequence" data-step="22">On June 30, the fiscal year ends and the process begins all over again!</p>
      <p>Now that you know more about what the budget process looks like, it's time to really hash out who gets involved in the process and what that involvement looks like.</p>
      <p></p>

<div id="involvement">
  <div id="inv-exp"><h3>Who's involved in the process?</h3>
    <p class="step sequence" data-step="23">Our key players in the budgeting process are <span class="highlighted">the Mayor</span> and the <span class="highlighted">City Council</span>, who have the most responsibility in the process. The Mayor is responsible for releasing several plans throughout the fiscal year, which are reviewed and responded to by the City Council, and in that sense, there’s a lot of back and forth between the two entities. However, they’re not the only players in the process.</p>

<p class="step sequence" data-step="24">The OMB, as noted, is heavily involved in approvals, forecasting budget estimates for upcoming fiscal years, and evaluating how much money is needed to power the city for another year. </p>

<p class="step sequence" data-step="25">Lobbyists, activist groups, and other interested parties also get involved at various points of the process, making phone calls to City Council members in order to get more funds allocated towards—or away from—causes they support or are against.</p>

<p class="step sequence" data-step="26">Arguably, one of the most important people involved in the budget process is… <span class="highlighted">you!</span> That is, if you’re a resident of NYC—there are many ways you can get involved if there’s something in the budget that you care about:</p>
<ul class="budget-overview">
  <li>Contact your city council member</li>
  <li>Contact the Mayor’s office</li>
  <li>If your district supports it, get active with <span class="highlighted">participatory budgeting!</span></li>
</ul>




</div>
  <div id="involved" class="viz"></div>
</div>
<p><a href="https://council.nyc.gov/pb/">Participatory budgeting</a> is a somewhat new phenomenon, begun in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1989. It was implemented in NYC in particular in 2011 by four Council Members, and <span class="highlighted">allows NYC residents in participating districts to vote on capital projects to improve their communities</span>—if you remember our review of the capital budget, this process deals with similar items. The value in this case needs to be $50,000, but the lifespan should still be at least five years.</p>

<p>With participatory budgeting, you get a say in what directly affects you, your neighborhood, and your family. Even if you don’t live in NYC, this process can be replicated for your local budgeting process—a phone call goes a long way! Because budgets are so directly a reflection of policy, it isn’t just economic, it’s political, and nowhere can we see this better than in what portions of the budget can actually pay for.</p>

<div><h2>Part Two: Chewing on the Slices</h2></div>
<p>Now that you've gotten to know the budget a little better, let's talk numbers.</p>
  
<article id="fiveyr-cont">
  <div id="fiveyrHBC" class="viz"></div>
  <div id="fiveyr-track">

<p>Over the past five years, the budget has steadily increased.</p>

<p class="step sequence" data-step="14">In 2017, $83.9 billion was adopted overall.</p>

<p>The following year, that increased by $3.2 billion.</p>

<p>In 2019, we saw another $3.9 billion increase.</p>

<p>2020 saw another $3.6 billion increase, but it was a unique year—because of the way fiscal years work, as we went over, allocation was done before the pandemic, and nowhere is that felt more…</p>

<p>… Than in the allocation for fiscal year 2021, which saw a $4.6 billion <span class="highlighted">decrease</span> from the prior year.</p>
</div>
</article>

<div><p>The COVID-19 pandemic affected so much about the world we live in now, but it also affected the way our budget is structured and how much was allocated in funding. So much about budgeting is about forecasting, and with the apportionment for 2020, there was no way to tell in the previous budget cycle that a global pandemic was about to take place.</p></div>
<div id="toptens">
  <div id="heatmap"></div>
<div><p>These are the top 10 agencies and departments by modified budget. Our first instinct might be to inspect these, but when we focus on the biggest department spenders, we tend to miss smaller stories that impact our communities and the way we live our daily lives. So let's try looking at something a little closer to the ground!</p></div>

</div>
<div><p>In  New York City, we have several levels of government ranging from federal to state to city to community. At the closest level, our community government is comprised of our community boards.<br><br>Community boards are a group of elected members from your local community who decide what projects should be worked on to improve the community. They're responsible for some public works projects as well as initiatives and hearing concerns from people within their field of influence.</p>
